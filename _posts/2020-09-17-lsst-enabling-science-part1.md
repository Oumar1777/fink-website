In order to enable new science with the LSST alert stream, brokers are developing a new layer in the time domain ecosystem, experimenting with new ways of enriching and filtering these data.

A diversity of solutions are being tested, but there is a need for more interaction between brokers, their community of users, and the alert generation teams. 

The transient sky community is invited to participate in a two half days virtual [workshop](https://www.lsstcorporation.org/meetings/2020-broker-workshop) on Oct 27-28th, 2020. This workshop is organized by the [ALeRCE](http://alerce.science/) and Fink alert brokers in collaboration with other alert broker teams and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and its Science Collaborations (SCs). It will be the first of a series of two mini workshops as part of our awarded [LSST Enabling Science Program 2020](https://www.lsstcorporation.org/2020-Enabling-Science-Award-Recipients).

The objectives of the first workshop in these series are the following:

- Presentation of envisioned products and services by broker teams.
- Presentation of detailed scientific cases by the SCs and a discussion on how brokers can most effectively help them reach their goals.
- Proposal of future community standards, benchmarks, or initiatives to achieve more interoperability and resilience.

The second workshop will be 4-6 months after this first workshop, where we will assemble developments and reflections from the different users and collaborations.
