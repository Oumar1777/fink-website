We are pleased to announce that Fink has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Project on 2020, January 29.

The purpose of this MoU is to distribute a stream of transient alerts originating from the ZTF public survey data to Fink. This agreement covers the period from the 1 January 2020 through 30 September 2020, or the end of the ZTF Phase I MSIP public surveys, whichever is earlier.
ZTF intends to renew if public alert streams are funded in ZTF Phase II, based on mutual agreement by both parties.

Since then Fink has been regularly polling data from ZTF, and the performances of the broker are excellent. Our raspberry is now restlessly monitoring the Fink broker and the ZTF alert distribution system!

_Raspberry 4 used by the Fink collaboration at IJCLab to monitor 24/7 the broker sub-systems deployed on the VirtualData cloud. ZTF dashboard is now added._

The live connection to the ZTF stream is valuable asset to the Fink collaboration to reach new milestones, and to perform robustness and maturity tests of the different components of the broker. Thanks ZTF!
