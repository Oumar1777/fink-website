The First Fink Workshop will take place at IJCLab on the 6 February 2020, just after the LSST-France meeting.

The workshop contains short presentations about the goals and the status of the project, tutorials detailing how to interact with Fink, and hands-on activities where the participants will learn how to build their own alert stream filters. Note that participants will need an account on eduroam (or any secured connections). There are still a few places left, so contact us if you want to register. More information on [indico](https://indico.in2p3.fr/event/20222/).
