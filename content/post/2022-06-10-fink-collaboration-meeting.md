We had our first in-person Collaboration Meeting last month in Annecy. This was 3 years after the start of the project, which included 2 years of pandemic. It was a pleasure to host and work with so many scientists!

The two days were super active, with a lot of discussions and hands-on tutorials. We were super happy to see all the new developments, and such a diversity in the science topics. You can find all the materials online: https://indico.in2p3.fr/event/26707/
