## What are Fink community projects?

A Fink community project is a self-governed group of one or more people, who agrees on producing deliverables which can add value to the Fink broker. Examples of deliverables are (non-exhaustive):

- Fink filter, that is implementation of series of selection cuts for given science goal(s)
- Fink science module, that is implementation and testing of added value method (e.g. algorithm) within Fink infrastructure.
- Software/algorithm (new software or algorithm integrated into Fink's infrastructure or in any of its components).
- science analysis
- outreach activities
- teaching/formation (enabling others to contribute)

Each community project team is completely self-governed (groups are free to decide on how they should organize management, work, meetings and how they choose team members). Fink projects can be transverse (covering several scientific or technological themes), and there can be several Fink projects per themes. Fink projects are responsible for their work, and get full credits for their results.

## How to propose a new Fink community project?


Anyone wishing to propose a new project must fill the [subscription form](https://forms.gle/s62cgUCXFSnmivFP8), and the Fink management team will organise a meeting to provide information on the process. During the creation phase of a project, Fink management can help a candidate project with:

- Logistic help in defining the project deliverable.
